# Tennis Analysis

## Introduction
Tennis Analysis is a computer vision-based project that analyzes tennis players in video footage to measure various performance metrics such as player speed, ball shot speed, and the number of shots taken. This project leverages deep learning techniques, including object detection and keypoint extraction, to accurately track player movements and ball trajectory.

The core technologies used in this project include:
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for detecting players and tracking the tennis ball in real time.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for extracting keypoints of the tennis court, allowing for precise spatial analysis.

This hands-on project provides an excellent opportunity to enhance machine learning and computer vision skills by working with state-of-the-art deep-learning models.

## Project Significance
The ability to analyze tennis matches using AI and computer vision can provide valuable insights for:
- **Performance Analysis**: Helps players and coaches evaluate movement, shot speed, and reaction times.
- **Match Strategy Optimization**: Provides data-driven insights into player positioning and shot patterns.
- **Automated Match Highlight Generation**: Identifies key moments such as powerful shots or long rallies.
- **Training Assistance**: Helps players refine their techniques by pinpointing areas of improvement.

## Models Used
This project relies on multiple deep-learning models to accomplish accurate detection and analysis:

### 1. YOLO v8 for Player Detection
- **Purpose**: Detects players in the video frames in real-time.
- **Why YOLO v8?**: YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a highly efficient object detection model that balances accuracy and speed, making it ideal for real-time sports analysis.
- **How it Works**: The model detects players and assigns bounding boxes to each player, making it easy to track their movements.

### 2. Fine-Tuned YOLO for Tennis Ball Detection
- **Purpose**: Detects and tracks the tennis ball throughout the match.
- **Fine-Tuning**: A pre-trained YOLO model is fine-tuned on a dataset of tennis ball images to improve detection accuracy.
- **Challenges Overcome**: Detecting a small, fast-moving object like a tennis ball is challenging, but fine-tuning the model enhances precision.

### 3. Court Keypoint Extraction using CNNs
- **Purpose**: Identifies the boundaries and key regions of the tennis court.
- **Why CNNs?**: Convolutional Neural Networks are effective for feature extraction from images and are used to detect court lines and keypoints.
- **Application**: Understanding the courtâ€™s structure helps determine shot locations, player positions, and in/out ball decisions.

## Training
The models are trained using custom datasets specifically prepared for tennis analysis:

1. **Training the Tennis Ball Detector using YOLO**
